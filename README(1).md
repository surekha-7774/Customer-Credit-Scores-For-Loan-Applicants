### Problem Statement:

Credit scores are crucial indicators of an individual's creditworthiness, impacting loan approvals, interest rates, and financial opportunities. To enable lending institutions to assess risk and borrowers to access better financial products, this case study aims to build a supervised machine learning model using a provided dataset. The objective is to predict the creditworthiness of loan applicants and categorize them into 'Good' or 'Bad' credit classes. By doing so, the model will assist institutions in making informed decisions about granting loans and minimizing potential losses, fostering financial stability for both lenders and borrowers. Compare the performance of different models and choose the best-performing one.
